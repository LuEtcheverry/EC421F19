# EC 421, Fall 2019

Welcome to **Economics 421: Introduction to Econometrics** (Fall 2019) at the University of Oregon (w/ [Luciana Etcheverry](https://luetcheverry.github.io/)).

The materials in this course were originally created by [Prof. Ed Rubin](https://edrub.in/). Big thanks to him for making it a public good!

For information on the course specifics, please see the [syllabus](https://raw.githack.com/luetcheverry/EC421F19/master/Syllabus/syllabus.pdf).

## Lecture slides

The slides below (linked by their topic) are .html files that will only work properly if you are connected to the internet. If you're going off grid, grab the PDFs (you'll miss out on gifs and interactive plots, but the equations will render correctly).
